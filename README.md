# PDF Table Extractor and CSV Merger

This Python script extracts tables from a PDF file and saves them as individual CSV files. It can also merge multiple CSV files into a single file.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python on your computer if it is not already installed.
2. Install the required Python modules by entering the command `pip install tabula-py pandas PyPDF2` in the terminal or command prompt.

## Usage

1. Place the PDF file(s) you want to extract tables from in a folder.
2. Run the code by opening the terminal or command prompt and navigating to the directory where the code file is saved. Then, enter the command: `python pdf_table_extractor.py`.
3. Enter the number `1` or `2` to select either the PDF table extraction or CSV merging operation, respectively.
4. If you selected the PDF table extraction option:
   a. Enter the name of the PDF file when prompted.
   b. Enter the name of the output folder where the CSV files will be saved when prompted.
   c. The code will extract tables from each page of the PDF file and save them as separate CSV files in the output folder.
5. If you selected the CSV merging option:
   a. Enter the name of the input folder containing the CSV files when prompted.
   b. Enter a common file name prefix for the CSV files when prompted (e.g., "output" if the CSV files are named "output1.csv", "output2.csv", etc.).
   c. Enter the name of the output file when prompted.
   d. Enter the name of the output folder where the merged CSV file will be saved when prompted.
   e. The code will merge all CSV files in the input folder with the specified prefix and save the merged file in the output folder.

## Notes

- The code uses the `tabula` module to extract tables from PDF files. The `lattice=True` parameter is used to handle tables with grid-like structures.
- The code drops columns that are completely empty or have generic names like "Unnamed:" and ".1".
- The code uses the `pandas` module to merge CSV files. The `glob` module is used to find all CSV files with the specified prefix in the input folder.
